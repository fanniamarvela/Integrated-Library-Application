# Integrated Library Application

In this project, I developed a simple integrated library management system designed to facilitate book lending operations. The application features four key functionalities: Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are essential for managing a book lending database. The project was implemented using Python and leverages fundamental programming concepts, including data collection, conditional statements, looping, and several supplementary features to enhance the application's functionality, ensuring seamless integration of all components within the system.
